# Go Desktop Creative Writing Application

This is just a starter application for a very lightweight creative writing application written in Go.

Usual installation and build steps for a Go project, nothing fancy at the moment.

## Roadmap

### v1.0

- Allow for basic editing/saving/opening of files.
- Basic formatting (need text wrap, make the page feel more comfortable as a "creative writing app")
- Very bare-bones styling options (italics, bold, header, line break)
- Update the environment to not use this split view (?) - Need alternative at some point

### v2.0

- Allow saving and opening of different file formats.

### v3.0

- TBD
